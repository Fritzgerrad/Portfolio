          I am a versatile enthusiast possessing adept technical skills as both a physicist and a software programmer.
           Additionally, I have critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that allow me to apply these skills effectively. <br><br>

          I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and attended Nazareth Primary School.
          From a young age, I demonstrated exceptional skills in mathematics and science subjects. 
          In 2012, I enrolled at Kings College Lagos, where I discovered my true passion for physics. <br><br>

          Subsequently, I pursued a degree in Industrial Physics at Covenant University in 2016. This program provided me with a solid foundation in theoretical and applied physics.
          My knowledge extends to classical and quantum mechanics, electronics, condensed matter physics, and their practical applications in everyday life. <br><br>

          Despite my physics background, I also developed a keen interest in software development.
          Through dedicated learning and practical experience, I acquired the necessary technical skills to become a valuable asset as a full-stack developer and data scientist. 
          My proficiency encompasses programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
          Moreover, I am well-versed in frameworks like Spring Boot, Django, and Node.js for backend development, as well as React for frontend, enabling me to create efficient and scalable web applications. 
          Additionally, I have experience with Relational Database Management Systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and proficiency in tools such as Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins for deployment and DevOps, making me a well-rounded developer. 
          Furthermore, I possess expertise in data science and analysis, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Beautiful Soup for web scraping and data extraction. 
          I also employ Tkinter for GUI presentation when building insightful models. <br><br>

          During my free time, I enjoy playing football with my friends or indulging in solitary activities such as listening to music or watching movies.
          Furthermore, I am passionate about language acquisition and, in addition to English and my native language Igbo, I have also acquired proficiency in Spanish and French through online resources.
