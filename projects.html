            <h3>Design and Construction of Home Air Quality System</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The study investigates the effects of abnormal temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels in the environment. 
                It aims to design a device capable of detecting and indicating the air quality in a given environment. 
                The device, once constructed, displays the values for temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide on an LCD screen, either within the environment or on an external Bluetooth device.
                 When these parameters reach dangerously abnormal levels, indicating a hazardous air quality, the device emits an alarm.

            <h3>Image Filter</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The Image Filter application allows users to upload an image and apply various filters to modify its appearance. 
                Users can select an image file from their device and see it displayed on the webpage. If any filters are applied, users can click the "Undo" button to revert the image back to its original state.
                 Basic filters such as "Make Red," "Make Green," and "Make Blue" allow users to change the color characteristics of the image. 
                Intermediate filters like "Make Blur," "Make Grey," and "Make Rainbow" offer more advanced modifications. Custom filters such as "Behind bars," "Black Pixel," and "White Pixel" provide specialized transformations.
                 The canvas on the webpage displays the modified image, and users can experiment with different filters to observe the visual transformations applied to their uploaded images.

              <h3>Developer Salary Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I analyzed data from StackOverflow, a popular website for developers, 
                where an online survey was conducted on software developers worldwide. The dataset consisted of responses to various questions on diverse topics.
                 I collected the data using APIs, explored it thoroughly, scraped additional data from the web, and derived meaningful insights from the analysis.
<br>
                For instance, I discovered the salary diversity between loyal employees and those who frequently changed jobs. Additionally, 
                I deduced that programmers who begin their careers at an earlier age tend to earn more compared to those who start later.
