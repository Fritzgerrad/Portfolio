            <h3>Image Filter</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The Image Filter application allows users to upload an image and apply various filters to modify its appearance. 
                Users can select an image file from their device and see it displayed on the webpage. If any filters are applied, users can click the "Undo" button to revert the image back to its original state.
                 Basic filters such as "Make Red," "Make Green," and "Make Blue" allow users to change the color characteristics of the image. 
                Intermediate filters like "Make Blur," "Make Grey," and "Make Rainbow" offer more advanced modifications. Custom filters such as "Behind bars," "Black Pixel," and "White Pixel" provide specialized transformations.
                 The canvas on the webpage displays the modified image, and users can experiment with different filters to observe the visual transformations applied to their uploaded images.

            <ul>
              <li>
                I analyzed that from a data from StackOverflow a popular website for developers where an online survey was conducted on software developers all over theworld.
                The data contained responses on various questions on diverse topics. I collecte the data using APIs, explored the data, scraped ome aditional data from the web,
                and developed a lot of meaningful insights from the data. For example I was able to identify the diversity in salary among loyal employees as opposed to those who witched Jobs often.
                I also deduced that programmers who start at an earlier age are more likely to earn more than those who start later.
